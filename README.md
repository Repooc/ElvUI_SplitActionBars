# ElvUI_SplitActionBars


This will allow you to split your actionbars at a specific button.  This is a good way to add maybe some weakauras (or whatever) in between.  This will help with actionbar paging with some classes so it's not weird.

Credit goes out to dlecina on github for the idea and some logic.  Made this quick addon mainly for them but will share with others and keep it up to date with ElvUI changes to the actionbar and/or codebase if it is changed.
